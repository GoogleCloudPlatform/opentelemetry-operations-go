# Google Cloud Monitoring exporter example

This example shows how to use [`go.opentelemetry.io/otel`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/) to instrument a simple Go application with metrics and export the metrics to [Google Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/)

## Setup environment

Before sending metrics to Google Cloud Monitoring, confirm the Cloud Monitoring API is enabled for the project you will use to access the API as described in [this document](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/enable-api).

You can find your current project ID using the command:

```
$ gcloud config get-value project
Your active configuration is: [example]
foo-project-214354
```

In this case, the project ID is `foo-project-214354`.

Next, set this project ID to the environment variable `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID` using the following command:

```
export GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
```

### Enable experimental features
The `exponential_histogram` example can optionally export [exemplars](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#exemplars). Enable experimental [exemplar sampling](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/blob/main/sdk/metric/internal/x/README.md#exemplars) support with :
```
export OTEL_GO_X_EXEMPLAR=true
export OTEL_METRICS_EXEMPLAR_FILTER=always_on
```

## Build and run the application

Once you ensure the API is enabled, then build the example application and run the executable. There are three separate examples showcasing the following - 
1. Exporting metrics via the SDK - [sdk](./sdk/) directory.
2. Exporting metrics via the OpenTelemetry Collector - [collector](./collector/).
3. Exporting histogram metrics via the SDK - [exponential_histogram](./exponential_histogram/).

Change the current directory to the example you wish to run, for example `cd sdk`, and then run the example using following commands:

```
$ go build -o metrics
$ ./metrics
2020/06/11 21:11:15 Most recent data: counter 110, observer 13.45
2020/06/11 21:11:15 Most recent data: counter 160, observer 16.02
2020/06/11 21:11:15 Most recent data: counter 134, observer 14.33
2020/06/11 21:11:15 Most recent data: counter 125, observer 15.12
...
```

To ensure you have enough data to create interesting charts for the Counter and Observer metrics generated by the example, keep the application running for at least five minutes.

*Note: For running the collector example, you need to have a locally running OpenTelemetry Collector, configured using the provided [sample config](./collector/sample-collector-config.yaml). Instructions for running OpenTelemetry Collector on your system can be found [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/#local).*

## Create dashboard

https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards?project=<your-project-id>

Once you think you have sent sufficient data, then create a dashboard. If you are learning how to use Google Cloud Monitoring, you can follow how to use charts step by step on [this document](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/charts).

When filling in the **Find resource type and metric box**, use the metric names "custom.googleapis.com/opentelemetry/counter-a" and "custom.googleapis.com/opentelemetry/observer-a".

If you already know how to use Cloud Monitoring and would just like to confirm the data is properly received, you can run the dashboard creation script bundled in the example sub-directory, either [sdk](./sdk/) or [exponential_histogram](./exponential_histogram/), with the following command :

```
$ ./create_dashboard.sh
```

This script creates a dashboard titled "OpenTelemetry exporter example/metric" or "OpenTelemetry - Exponential Histogram example" depending on the example .

You should be able to view line charts like below once you create the dashboard.

*Note: This script is configured to create dashboard which displays the metrics generated via the `sdk` example.*
