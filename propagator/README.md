# OpenTelemetry Google Cloud Trace Propagators

[![Docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/opentelemetry-operations-go/propagator?status.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/opentelemetry-operations-go/propagator)

This package contains Trace Context Propagators for use with [Google Cloud
Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace) that make it compatible with
[OpenTelemetry](http://opentelemetry.io). 

There are two available propagators in this package:

### `CloudTraceOneWayPropagator`

The `CloudTraceOneWayPropagator` works like the standard `TraceContext`
propagator if a `traceparent` header is present. If `traceparent` is not found,
it reads the `X-Cloud-Trace-Context` header for trace and span IDs, and creates
the corresponding `traceparent` header.

This is useful for ensuring spans created in your code are attached to the traces that some Google Cloud services [automatically trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/overview#configurations_with_automatic_tracing).

### `CloudTraceFormatPropagator`

The `CloudTraceFormatPropagator` reads and writes the `X-Cloud-Trace-Context` header only.

## Differences between Google Cloud Trace and W3C Trace Context

Google Cloud Trace encodes trace information in the `X-Cloud-Trace-Context` HTTP
header, using the format described in the [Trace documentation](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/setup#force-trace).

OpenTelemetry uses the newer, W3C standard
[`traceparent` header](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#traceparent-header)

There is an important semantic difference between Cloud Trace's
`TRACE_TRUE` flag, and W3C's `sampled` flag.

As outlined in the [Trace
documentation](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/setup#force-trace), setting
the `TRACE_TRUE` flag will cause trace information to be collected.

This differs from the W3C behavior, where the [`sampled`
flag](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#sampled-flag) indicates that the
caller *may* have recorded trace information, but does not necessarily impact
the sampling done by other services.

To preserve the Cloud-Trace behavior when using `traceparent`, you can use the
[`ParentBased`
sampler](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace#ParentBased) like
so:

```go
import sdktrace go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace
sampler := sdktrace.ParentBased(
    sdktrace.NeverSample(),
    sdktrace.WithRemoteParentSampled(sdktrace.AlwaysSample()))
)
```
